Graph Analysis

1.	High RMSF values at residues 0-2:
	•	The highest RMSF values are observed at residues 0, 1, and 2, indicating that these residues are highly flexible.
	•	This region corresponds to the N-terminus, which is often more flexible or disordered.
2.	Low RMSF values from residues 3-30:
	•	From residue 3 onwards, the RMSF values are generally lower, mostly below 0.025 nm.
	•	This suggests that these regions are relatively stable and consistent across the ensemble structures.
3.	Slight increase near residue 30:
	•	There is a slight increase in RMSF near residue 30, reflecting potential flexibility at the C-terminus.

Functional Implications

	•	The high RMSF at the beginning (residues 0-2) indicates high structural flexibility, which could be related to potential ligand binding sites or interaction regions.
	•	In contrast, the low RMSF observed throughout most of the protein suggests core stability of the structure.
