* Nucleotide Binding Sites
•	Nucleotides were bound at both the N-terminus (start) and C-terminus (end) of the protein structure in the predictions.
•	The analysis revealed that AF2(Alphafold2) and AF3(Alphafold3) models exhibited notable differences in the nucleotide binding regions, particularly at the start and end residues.
•	This suggests that the two models predicted the nucleotide interactions differently, indicating uncertainty in the binding mode of nucleotides.

* Disordered Region:
•	The significant distance difference observed near residue 50 corresponded to a disordered region, as confirmed by VMD using B-factor or plDDT score color coding.
•	In VMD, the disordered region appeared red, indicating high prediction uncertainty.
•	Disordered regions often show greater structural variability between models due to the inherent flexibility or poorly defined secondary structures, leading to larger discrepancies.

* Functional Implications
•	Differences at the nucleotide binding sites suggest variations in how AF2 and AF3 predict the binding mode, which could affect the protein’s biochemical activity, especially in regions critical for nucleotide interaction.
•	The disordered region near residue 50 reflects high prediction uncertainty, as expected for flexible loops or less defined structures. This variability could impact the protein’s stability or function.
